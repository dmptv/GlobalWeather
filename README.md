## Project Overview

Provide a high-level overview of the project, including its purpose and main features.

## Architecture

This project follows the VIPER architecture pattern, which stands for View, Interactor, Presenter, Entity, and Router. It promotes a clean separation of concerns and modularity in the codebase.

- **View**: Describe the role and responsibilities of the View layer.
- **Interactor**: Describe the role and responsibilities of the Interactor layer.
- **Presenter**: Describe the role and responsibilities of the Presenter layer.
- **Entity**: Describe the role and responsibilities of the Entity layer.
- **Router**: Describe the role and responsibilities of the Router layer.

Additionally, we use Combine for reactive programming and Composite VIPER Modules for modularization.
